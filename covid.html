        <h1>How COVID has affected my life.</h1>
        <p>The pandemic has been a once-in-a-lifetime, major event in my life and the lives of all people living today. My uncle spent the last year of his life isolated in a nursing home before contracting and dying of COVID which was a very sad event for our family. My mom’s small business is our only source of income, and was greatly negatively affected. We had to sell our house and move into a rental house in order to keep the business open.
        </p>
        <p>When I first heard about COVID, I wasn't really worried, I thought “oh, it’s just gonna be like flu season, and I will get an extra week off from school.” Before quarantine, I had gone up to Chicago to visit my family for spring break. A few days in, I got news that we would not be going back to school indefinitely, and I could not travel home. I ended up having to stay at my dad’s house and wasn’t able to come home for three months.
        </p>
        <p>Learning during COVID was very difficult, especially with some classes like PE, where I had to do exercises, and I'm sure the people in the apartment below me really appreciated the sound of jumping jacks above them. During 6th grade in online It really felt like many classes just sort of stopped. It was the first time we had ever had to do this, so many classes had no meetings, and I never saw some of my teachers after that.
        </p>
        <p>During 7th grade I had gotten used to online school, so my grades were a lot better. I still had an issue with turning in assignments, because it would be so easy to forget. I really hated not being able to see my friends, especially since I had spent 6th grade making them. One thing I did like about online learning was that all I needed was a computer and an internet connection, so that meant that I could visit with my family for longer and more often.
        </p>
        <p>I was relieved to finally go back to school in person in 8th grade, but it was also weird. I had gone from 6th grade all the way to 8th grade. I just felt like I had magically grown 2 years older, and I am sure that many other people have had the same experience.
